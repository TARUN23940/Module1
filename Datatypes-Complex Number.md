# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## 💻 Program
~~~
a=int(input()) 
b=int(input()) 
x=complex(a,b) 
print(x) 
print(x.real) 
print(x.imag)
~~~
## Output
![e4eb4686-2726-43c3-a559-7093f09154e8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a705597b-a5c0-4a71-bf9f-3363b2626966)

## Result
Thus the prgram has been successfully executed.
